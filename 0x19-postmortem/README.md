-------------------
Issue Summary
Incident: A failure in the hospital's patient data recording system.
Impact: The patient's treatment was delayed due to missing data in the database, resulting in the patient's death. The hospital incurred a $2 million settlement cost.
Number of affected users: 1 patient (and indirectly, his family).
Date: [Insert Date]

Timeline (all times Pacific Time)
08:00 AM: Nurses begin their shifts and start recording patient data.
09:30 AM: Three nurses simultaneously make POST requests to the system to record patient data.
09:31 AM: One of the POST requests fails to complete due to a system error, but the interface incorrectly indicates success.
10:00 AM: Nurses realize there is missing data when reviewing patient records.
10:15 AM: Attempts to locate and re-enter the missing data begin.
11:00 AM: Efforts to re-enter data fail, causing further delay in patient treatment.
01:00 PM: Patient's condition worsens significantly due to delayed treatment.
02:00 PM: Patient passes away.
03:00 PM: Family is informed about the incident.
Next Day, 09:00 AM: Family files a legal complaint against the hospital.
Following Week: Legal proceedings begin, and the hospital eventually settles for $2 million.
Root Cause
The root cause of the incident was a race condition in the hospital's patient data recording system. When multiple nurses made POST requests simultaneously, the system could not handle the concurrency properly, leading to one of the requests not being recorded in the database. However, the user interface incorrectly showed that the request was successful, causing a false sense of completion.

Resolution and Recovery
Immediate Action: The IT team was alerted, and an emergency meeting was held to address the issue.
System Analysis: The team identified the race condition in the POST request handling logic.
Temporary Fix: A manual review process was implemented to ensure all critical data entries were verified for accuracy and completeness.
Permanent Fix: The system was updated to handle concurrent POST requests correctly. Acknowledgment mechanisms were improved to ensure the user interface accurately reflects the status of data entries.
Review and Documentation: The incident was thoroughly reviewed, and documentation was updated to prevent similar issues in the future.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Technical Improvements:

Concurrency Handling: Refactor the code to handle concurrent requests more efficiently.
Improved Logging: Enhance logging mechanisms to capture detailed information about each request and its status.
Interface Accuracy: Update the user interface to reflect the true status of data entries.
Process Changes:

Verification Steps: Implement additional verification steps to ensure data integrity before confirming successful entries.
Manual Review Protocol: Establish a temporary manual review protocol for critical data entries until the system is confirmed to be reliable.
Training and Awareness:

Staff Training: Conduct training sessions for nurses and staff to recognize and report inconsistencies in the system promptly.
Incident Response Drills: Perform regular incident response drills to ensure quick and effective action in case of future issues.
Monitoring and Auditing:

Continuous Monitoring: Set up continuous monitoring of the data recording system to detect and address issues in real-time.
Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits of the system and processes to identify and mitigate potential risks.
Communication Improvements:

Transparent Communication: Ensure clear and transparent communication channels between the IT department, medical staff, and administration.
Incident Reporting: Establish a robust incident reporting system to capture and address issues before they escalate.
